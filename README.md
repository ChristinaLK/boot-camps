UW-Madison Software Carpentry Boot Camp
=======================================
Welcome!

August 25-26, 2014
-------------------

3rd Floor Teaching Lab, Discovery Building
------------------

This repository contains the course material for the Software
Carpentry boot camp hosted by UW-Madison's 
[Advanced Computing Infrastructure (ACI) initiative](https://aci.wisc.edu) for researchers at the UW-Madison.

Schedule
-----------

This bootcamp has been structured around the concepts put forth in the
recent paper "Best Practices for Scientific Computing" by G. Wilson,
et al (at the top of this repository). In so doing, the sessions names 
have been chosen to correspond
with some of the most important practices to start early in the research process.

Setup and Preparation
-----------

Please follow the 
[setup instructions on our Bootcamp Web Page](http://uw-madison-aci.github.io/2014-08-25-wisc/),
though you will not need to install SQLite.
