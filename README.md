UW-Madison Software Carpentry Boot Camp
=======================================
Welcome!

January 13 & 14, 2014

Discovery Building, Researcher's Link

This repository contains the course material for the upcoming Software
Carpentry boot camp being hosted by the Advanced Computing
Infrastructure organization at the UW-Madison.

Schedule
-----------

This bootcamp has been structured around the concepts put forth in the
recent paper "Best Practices for Scientific Computing" by G. Wilson,
et al. In so doing, the sessions names have been chosen to correspond
with some of the most important practices to start early.
