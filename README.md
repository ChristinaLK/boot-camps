UW-Madison Software Carpentry Boot Camp
=======================================
Welcome!

January 13-16, 2015
-------------------

Location TBD
------------------

This repository contains the course material for the Software
Carpentry boot camp hosted by UW-Madison's 
[Advanced Computing Infrastructure (ACI) initiative](https://aci.wisc.edu) for researchers at the UW-Madison.

Schedule
-----------

This bootcamp has been structured around the concepts put forth in the
recent paper "[Best Practices for Scientific Computing](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001745)" by G. Wilson,
et al (at the top of this repository). In so doing, the sessions names 
have been chosen to correspond
with some of the most important practices to start early in the research process.

Setup and Preparation
-----------

You will need to bring a laptop to all sessions of the bootcamp.
Before you arrive, please
[follow the instructions to install python and other software](setup/README.md).

Pre-Camp Survey
-----------
Please fill out the [Pre-Camp Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1qVqOzryfwywtdLqupN1TQlF99dk9tn1_MrINoe_JuUU/viewform), if you are in physical attendance at our Software Carpentry Bootcamp on January 13-16.
