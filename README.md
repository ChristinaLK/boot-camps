UW-Madison Software Carpentry Workshop
=======================================
Welcome!

January 13-16
-------------------

3rd Floor Teaching Lab, Discovery Building, UW-Madison Campus
------------------

This repository contains the course material for the Software
Carpentry workshop hosted by UW-Madison's 
[Advanced Computing Infrastructure (ACI) initiative](https://aci.wisc.edu) for researchers at the UW-Madison.

Schedule
-----------

This workshop has been structured around the concepts put forth in the
recent paper "[Best Practices for Scientific Computing](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001745)" by G. Wilson,
et al (at the top of this repository). In so doing, the sessions names 
have been chosen to correspond
with some of the most important practices to start early in the research process.

Setup and Preparation
-----------

You will need to bring a laptop to all sessions of the workshop.
Before you arrive, please
[follow the instructions to install python and other software](setup/README.md).
